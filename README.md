# Cyberbullying-Detection-Using-BERT
Cyberbullying is a significant issue in the digital age, especially in regions with diverse languages. This project focuses on detecting cyberbullying in Malayalam, a language spoken in Kerala, India. The   approach uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to develop a system that can identify cyberbullying in Malayalam text. The project involves creating a dataset, training the system to recognize cyberbullying, and evaluating its performance. It involves the collection and curation of a comprehensive dataset comprising both normal and cyberbullying-related content in Malayalam.
The NLP-based cyberbullying detection model incorporates features such as sentiment analysis, semantic similarity, and contextual understanding to identify potential instances of cyberbullying. Additionally, the project considers ethical aspects and aims to provide a responsible and inclusive solution. The outcomes of this project could significantly contribute to cybersecurity and online safety, particularly for the Malayalam-speaking community.
